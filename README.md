# Conways-Game-of-Life
Conway's Game of Life in Python

I decided to take a crack at John Conway's Game of Life in Python. It's technically finished (the best kind of finished). However, it's a little wonky because only the cells on the inside of the grid ever update and, due to the edges never changing, sometimes it exhibits wonky behavior over there.

When you run the "game_of_life.py" file the program runs in the terminal. You have to change the symbols for alive and dead to ASCII characters if you want to run from the command prompt or powershell.

Libraries used:
 - NumPy
 - random
 - time
 - os
