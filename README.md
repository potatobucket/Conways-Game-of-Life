Conway's Game of Life in Python

I decided to take a crack at John Conway's Game of Life in Python. It's technically finished (the best kind of finished). However, it's a little wonky because only the cells on the inside of the grid ever update and, due to the edges never changing, sometimes it exhibits wonky behavior over there.

Libraries used:
 - NumPy
 - random
 - time
 - os
